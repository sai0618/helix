I would like to send you an open book assignment. You can take a week to complete it and share the personal git link.

Please go through the below project details and let me know if you need any clarification: Time to complete 1 week 

**Complete this by Monday EOD and Demo the following in the follow up calls on Tuesday / Wednesday:**

* Working cluster with accessible application endpoint  
* Screenshot or export of Grafana dashboard  
* Sample BigQuery queries demonstrating log analysis  
* Troubleshooting scenario: Document one issue you encountered and how you resolved it

***Note: Features not available in GCP free tier, you can skip those steps.***

**End‑to‑End Architecture Write‑Up: GCP Project with Two GKE Clusters, Two Web Applications, Multi‑Pod Deployment & Full Observability**

**1\. Project Structure & Governance**

A new GCP project is provisioned following organizational guardrails and landing‑zone standards. Key components include:

* **Project-level configuration**  
  * Resource hierarchy (Folder → Project)  
  * IAM roles for Dev, Ops, SRE, and CI/CD  
  * VPC creation with segregated subnets for GKE, load balancers, and monitoring/ops  
  * Centralized logging & monitoring sinks (Cloud Logging, Cloud Monitoring)  
* **Networking**  
  * Shared VPC (optional) if your enterprise networking team centrally manages ingress/egress  
  * Private Service Access for Google APIs  
  * Cloud NAT for outbound internet egress from clusters  
  * Firewall rules for cluster node pools and services

---

**2\. GKE Cluster Architecture**

Two Google Kubernetes Engine clusters are deployed to support high availability, environment separation, or region‑based redundancy.

**Cluster 1 (e.g., Primary)**

* Region: us-central1 (example)  
* Mode: **GKE Standard** or **Autopilot** depending on operational model  
* Node Pools:  
  * General-purpose pool for web workloads  
  * Optional separate pool for system workloads (e.g., ingress, service mesh)

**Cluster 2 (e.g., Secondary)**

* Region: us-east1 / DR region  
* Same node pool and configuration pattern to maintain symmetry  
* Can be used for:  
  * Active/Active deployment  
  * Active/Passive failover  
  * Blue/Green or canary deployments

**Cluster Networking**

* **VPC-native clusters** using alias IP ranges  
* Dedicated subnet per cluster (e.g., gke-primary-subnet, gke-secondary-subnet)  
* Cloud DNS for internal/external records  
* Internal load balancers for east‑west communication

---

**3\. Application Deployment Design**

Two independent web applications are deployed to both clusters.

**Web Application A**

* Stateless microservice  
* Deployment with **multiple pods** (ReplicaSet/Deployment)  
* Config stored in ConfigMaps/Secrets  
* Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) configured based on CPU or custom metrics

**Web Application B**

* Stateless; can use GCP services like Pub/Sub, Cloud SQL, or MemoryStore (Redis).  
* Replicated across clusters to ensure resilience

**Ingress & Traffic Distribution**

Depending on your global strategy:

**Global External HTTPS Load Balancer**

* Uses **Multi‑cluster Ingress (MCI)** or **Multi‑cluster Services (MCS)**  
* Single global IP → routes traffic to nearest healthy cluster  
* Health checks ensure cluster failover

**Inter‑Service Communication**

* Service Mesh (Anthos Service Mesh optional)  
  * Mutual TLS  
  * Traffic shaping (canaries, blue/green)  
  * Distributed tracing hooks

---

**4\. Customer Traffic: End‑to‑End Flow**

Below is a detailed walkthrough of how external customer traffic reaches your web applications.

---

**Step 1: DNS Resolution**

* Customer hits [https://www.yourapp.com](https://www.yourapp.com/)  
* Cloud DNS records map domain → Global Load Balancer IP

---

**Step 2: Global Load Balancer**

* Customer’s request reaches **Google Global Load Balancer**  
* LB performs:  
  * SSL termination at edge  
  * URI‑based routing (if needed)  
  * WAF (Cloud Armor) threat inspection  
  * Geo-based load balancing across clusters

---

**Step 3: Traffic Routing to GKE Clusters**

* LB forwards traffic to cluster‑specific NEGs (Network Endpoint Groups)  
* Multi‑Cluster Ingress ensures:  
  * Proximity routing (closest cluster)  
  * Failover if cluster unavailable

---

**Step 4: GKE Ingress Controller**

* Cluster Ingress controller (GKE Ingress or NGINX/ASM Ingress) receives request  
* Forwards to appropriate Kubernetes Service

---

**Step 5: Service → Pods**

* Kubernetes Service (type: ClusterIP or NodePort behind NEG) load‑balances across multiple pods  
* Pod replicas ensure:  
  * Resiliency  
  * Horizontal scaling  
  * Rolling updates with zero downtime

---

**Step 6: Application Response**

* Application processes request  
* Response flows back through:  
  * Pods → Service → Ingress → LB → Customer  
* Latency, logs, and traces are collected automatically

---

**5\. Observability (Logging, Monitoring, Tracing)**

End‑to‑End observability stack is implemented using GCP native capabilities.

**Cloud Logging**

* Container logs via GKE logging agent  
* Ingress, LB, VPC, firewall logs  
* Centralized logging bucket or export to SIEM

**Cloud Monitoring**

* Metrics for:  
  * Pod CPU/memory usage  
  * Node health  
  * HPA scaling events  
  * Ingress & LB metrics (latency, 5xx, request volumes)  
* **Observability with BigQuery & Grafana**  
  * Configure Cloud Logging to export logs to BigQuery  
  * Set up log exports for:  
    * Application logs  
    * GKE cluster logs (control plane, node logs)  
  * Use Cloud-hosted Grafana  
  * Create a Grafana dashboard with at least 4 panels:  
    * Query BigQuery for application error rates over time  
    * Pod restart counts by namespace  
    * Request latency percentiles (p50, p95, p99)  
    * Resource utilization trends (CPU/Memory)

**Cloud Trace**

* Distributed tracing across services  
* Shows latency breakdown for each hop

**Cloud Profiler**

* CPU/memory profiling for live applications

**Error Reporting**

* Automatic aggregation of application exceptions

**Optional Enhancements**

* Prometheus/Grafana via managed Prometheus  
* Anthos Service Mesh telemetry  
* Uptime checks & synthetic monitoring

---

**6\. High Availability & Disaster Recovery**

* Two GKE clusters → cross‑regional redundancy  
* Multi‑cluster ingress → automatic failover  
* State handled via:  
  * Cross‑regional storage (Cloud SQL HA, Memorystore replication, Firestore multi‑region)  
* Backups:  
  * Cloud SQL automated backups & point‑in‑time recovery  
  * GKE etcd backups  
  * Artifact Registry backup policies

---

**7\. Security**

* Workload Identity for secure service account mapping  
* Secrets handled via Secret Manager  
* Private GKE clusters (optional)  
* Cloud Armor WAF rules  
* Binary Authorization for image attestation

---

**8\. Deliverables:**

* Infrastructure as Code: Terraform to reproduce the entire setup  
* Documentation:  
  * Architecture diagram  
  * Step-by-step setup instructions  
  * BigQuery schema and sample queries used in Grafana  
  * Design decisions and rationale

---

* A new GCP project  
* Two GKE clusters for high availability or multi‑region strategy  
* Two web applications deployed with scalable multi‑pod replicas  
* Global load-balancing with intelligent traffic distribution
